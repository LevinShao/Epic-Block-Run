# Epic Block Run

Epic Block Run is a small game development project that I have been working on for a few weeks in the Unity game engine. It's basically a game where you get to control the movement of a square character. 
The objective of the game is to help the character get to the end of 6 levels, with each level being harder than the preceeding one. Level 1 is the easiest, and Level 6 is the hardest.
